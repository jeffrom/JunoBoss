# junoboss
MIDI conversion tool for OS X

This was created to convert sysex to CC messages and vice versa. Ableton doesn't deal with sysex and that's what my friend's juno 106 used to control itself. His synth also had a problem with saving patches. This program solved both of those problems. We were able to reasonably automate juno 106 parameters using this. Then some time later i tried to update all the code and probably broke everything.
